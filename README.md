# react-native-slack-usernames-game
A simple game to allow people in a slack channel to remember the names of the users and their avatars.

##How to use it
- add your Slack personal token (that you can find here: https://api.slack.com/web) in configConstants.js.
- "npm install" from the home directory.
- "npm start".
- "cd ios"
- "pod install"
- "open FriendlyGame.xcworkspace" with xcode
- run the app in the simulator or on your device (for now only iPhone 6 plus supported, there are some issues with the layout that is not optimised for other devices, to be fixed soon).
